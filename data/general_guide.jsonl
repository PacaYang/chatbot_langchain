Unlike allergy pills or shots, our proprietary proteins, WhiskerBlock and EnviroBlock, directly deactivate allergens in your home to prevent them getting in touch with you. This technology is safe, effective, easy to use, and non-invasive for you and your pets!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are allergens?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Allergens are harmless proteins that can trigger allergic reactions when people are exposed to them. The severity and duration of allergies can vary widely depending on the person, how much of the allergen they're exposed to, and other environmental factors.\n\n\nFor example, cats produce a protein called Fel d 1, which is the main cause of cat allergies for most people. Our neutralizing spray is specially formulated to deactivate Fel d 1, and we've conducted extensive testing to confirm that this is the only deactivation our WhiskerBlock Alpha is designed to perform, ensuring its effectiveness and safety."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Pacagen\u2019s technology?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pacagen\u2019s allergen-neutralizing technology works like a tiny version of an antibody\u2014about one-tenth the size! Instead of entering your body like pills or allergy shots, it works by deactivating allergens in your environment. We\u2019ve done extensive research to make sure it works quickly, effectively, and is safe for both people and pets. Similar types of technology are also widely used by scientists around the world, so you can feel confident in its safety!"}]}

If you're unsure of where to start, we recommend you try the spray for the allergen that you feel affects you the most. You can always add others later if needed to find the best combination for your home. Please reach out to support@pacagen.com if you're unsure and we'd be happy to give input based on your specific situation and needs!"}]}

Many of our team members are fellow pet parents, so we care about furry members\u2019 well-being just as much. All our products are non-toxic and safe for both pets and human, and our research team conducted dozen of studies \u2014 accumulating thousands of data point \u2014 to ensure the safety and effectiveness of our products.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Are your products safe for pregnant people and babies?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While we haven't conducted formal studies on pregnant individuals or babies due to ethical guidelines, we recognize the importance of protecting these sensitive groups from allergens. That\u2019s why our sprays are made with only ingredients considered safe to use around them. Since our products are applied topically and not absorbed into the body, they should be safe for use in these situations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I mix the powder with water instead of the stabilizing solution?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Definitely NOT! The stabilizing solution is formulated to maximize the effectiveness and stability of our WhiskerBlock and EnviroBlock proteins. Mixing with water (either tap water or distilled water) will significantly shorten the shelf life and reduce their effectiveness, and we strongly recommend mixing the powder with our stabilizing solutions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does your product contain other allergens?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, as we emphasize the safety and effectiveness of our products, No common allergens were added to our product, and we specifically formulated it to be safe to use around humans and pets."}]}

We also ensure that all of our partners share a similar commitment to environmental responsibility."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the spray work?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our allergen neutralizing sprays, unlike other products in the market, are unique in its technology. Instead of introducing something to your body, we took advantage of alpaca-inspired protein technology that resembles a miniaturized antibody. Similar to the antibody in our body, our proprietary protein WhiskerBlock and EnviroBlock, recognize and deactivate allergens in the environment to prevent them from triggering your allergy reactions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are stabilizing solutions and allergen neutralizing powders in the pack?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The allergen-neutralizing powder is most effective when dissolved in our specially formulated stabilizing solution, which also helps preserve the shelf life of the active ingredient, WhiskerBlock Alpha. We strongly advise against mixing the powder with any other liquid (including distilled or tap water), as this can compromise both the effectiveness and stability of the final spray."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does the spray have a scent? Do you have unscented or fragrance-free sprays?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our WhiskerBlock & EnviroBlock proteins have a natural scent - just like your protein powders carry a distinct smell. We\u2019ve added a very small amount of naturally extracted lavender and morning glory fragrance to balance it out. Most customers say the scent is barely noticeable after spraying. If you're sensitive to fragrance, we recommend trying our fragrance-free (natural) version instead, which is only available if you specifically request it by contacting support@pacagen.com (due to limited inventory). Note that the natural available for our Cat and Dust allergen neutralizing sprays. *Natural versions available in the US only."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the food topper work and can I replace the spray with food topper?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The food topper contains the same active ingredient\u2014WhiskerBlock Alpha\u2014as the spray. When ingested, WhiskerBlock Alpha works by deactivating Fel d 1 proteins in a cat\u2019s saliva and dander, helping reduce the amount of allergen shed into the environment.\nWhile the food topper addresses the allergen at its source, it does not neutralize allergens that have already accumulated in the surroundings as the spray does. Therefore, the two products are not interchangeable, and we strongly recommend using them together to minimize active allergens and maximize the overall effectiveness of WhiskerBlock Alpha."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How long does it take to see results from the topper?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Allergy responses can vary widely between individuals, but many of our customers notice a significant improvement within two weeks of using the food topper as directed.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How long does one jar of food topper last?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Cat Food Topper should last about 4 weeks, although this may vary depending on the amount you serve to your cat."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I have multiple cats, how do I feed the food topper?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For optimal results, we recommend feeding the topper separately to ensure each cat receives \u215b teaspoon per meal.

However, after the components are mixed together, the spray will only remain effective for up to 2 months (if kept refrigerated). This shelf life reflects the activity of our proprietary WhiskerBlock/EnviroBlock ingredient, which are special proteins that neutralize allergens. As with most proteins, they grow less stable once dissolved in solution."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I heat up the spray or use it in a mister/humidifier?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We strongly discourage putting our products into devices that heat it up (such as most misters and humidifiers).

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can the Cat, Dog, or Dust sprays be used together at the same time?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, there should be no problems using them at the same time.

The powder contains our proprietary ingredient, which is most effective when mixed together with the solution we provide.\n\n\nThe ingredients in the Powder:\n* Pacagen\u2019s proprietary ingredient \u2014 WhiskerBlock Alpha for cat allergens, WhiskerBlock Beta for dog allergens, or EnviroBlock Alpha for dust allergens\n* NaCl\n* Glycine\n* Leucine\n* Morning Glory Scent\n* English Lavender Scent\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Potassium Sorbate\n* Silica\n\n\nThese are the ingredients in the Solution:\n* Acetic acid buffer\n* Glycerol\n* Ethylhexylglycerin\n* Phenoxyethanol\n* Sodium Chloride\n* Glycine\n* Leucine\n* Distilled water"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the best practices with the Allergen Neutralizing Sprays to get the best results?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We recommend following a regular routine of spraying every 2-3 days in allergen \u201chot zones\u201d \u2014 places throughout your home that the allergens are most likely to accumulate. For cats and dogs, this is usually your furniture, carpets, bedding, or any other areas that your pets typically hang around and shed their hair. For dust, the \u201chot zones\u201d are usually places like curtains, carpets, bedding, and vents. Allergens can also be airborne, so spraying in the air is also recommended for all types of allergens. \n\n\nFor cat and dog allergens, we recommend vacuuming and cleaning surfaces throughout your household before you use the spray. This will expose the allergens that would be otherwise hard to target, allowing for our spray to finish off the job. In addition, many of our customers have reported great results after applying our spray to a pet brush and grooming their cat or dog with it. In contrast, for dust allergens we advise you to clean very cautiously prior to using the spray. This is because aggressively sweeping and dusting may unleash dust allergens into the air, further agitating your sensitivity.\n\n\nFor all the Allergen Neutralizing Sprays, the effectiveness should last for many days with each application, but slowly fades over time. Due to this, consistency is key to seeing the best results! On that note, we\u2019d highly recommend joining our Autoship & Save plan to receive regular shipments straight to your doorstep."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I spray this directly on my cat or dog?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Although we generally recommend applying around the household, there are no harmful side effects of spraying on your cat or dog directly. The main issue would be that some pets don't tend to like getting wet \u2014 so apply at your own discretion! Alternatively, some of our customers have had a lot of success spraying our product on a hair brush and grooming their pet regularly with it. Not only would this help them shed some allergen-dense hair, but it\u2019d also apply our active ingredient directly to the source of allergens."}]}
